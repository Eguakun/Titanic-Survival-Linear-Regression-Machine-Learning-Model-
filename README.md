# Titanic-Survival-Linear-Regression-Machine-Learning-Model-
Linear regression identifies the linear relationship between variables. In this program we are using the kaggle titanic data set. We just pass the features of the data point that we would like to predict into the equation of the line and use the output as our prediction.


After analyzing this information, we should notice the following:

The majority of the passengers are in their 20's or 30's
The majority of the  passengers are male
The majority  of the passengers are in "Third" class
Females have a much higher chance of survival
